                This is a free craft class organized by CraftWali Team. Generally, It is taken on the last friday of each month. Spending the Jumu'a Day with littol souls, gossiping, sharing stories of islam or any scientific fact related to the craft are the motives of this program.

            <h3>Islamic History And Craft</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this course is to make familiar the Golden-history of The Muslims among our next generation. We believe that knowing history teaches us in many ways, shapes our thoughts and helps us to be a better Muslim. Making My very own Nabi Journal also give them pleasure with profound learnings.

            <h3>AmazingScience</h3>
            <p>
                What? Why???
                Asking Question is the fitrah of a child. Inspiringing 'Questioning Culture' and guiding them to a valid one is the work here!Besides, Science sometimes drive this little ones away from Rabbul 'Alamin and make them Skeptic. So, making a bridge between the knowledge of Allah's Deen & Modern Science and presenting the setbacks of the science before them are also so important. May Allah make it easy for all of us.
                Allahumma Barik!
